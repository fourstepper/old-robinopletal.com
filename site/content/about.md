### Me

Hi, I am Robin Opletal and on the net I go by the name *fourstepper*.

As my day job, I work as a Linux and Network Administrator in Prague, Czech Republic.

### The blog

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), ran in Docker and served via `Traefik`. If you would like to see any of the code, you are free to do so: https://git.sr.ht/~fourstepper/robinopletal.com
